Real-Time Next-Word Prediction for Low-Resource Languages
Overview
This project focuses on next-word prediction for low-resource languages, specifically targeting Hinglish (Hindi-English code-mixed) datasets. The goal is to create a robust solution for predicting the next word in real-time, tailored to handle the challenges posed by multilingual and code-mixed text.

Low-resource languages often lack extensive datasets, making traditional NLP approaches less effective. This project provides a scalable and efficient framework for enhancing text prediction capabilities for such languages.

Features
Code-Mixed Language Support: Special handling for Hinglish, with plans to extend to other low-resource languages.
Preprocessing: Advanced tokenization, normalization, and cleaning for code-mixed datasets.
Custom Model Architecture: Designed for accurate next-word prediction with minimal latency.
Real-Time Implementation: Suitable for integration in chat applications or smart typing systems.
Scalable Framework: Modular structure for easy customization and enhancement.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
NLTK for tokenization and preprocessing
scikit-learn for traditional ML models
PyTorch (or equivalent) for custom deep learning models
API Integration: Flask (optional, for deploying the model)
Dataset: Hinglish conversational dataset (preprocessed and tokenized)
